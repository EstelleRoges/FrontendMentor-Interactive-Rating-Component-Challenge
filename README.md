## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- Sass
- JavaScript

### What I learned

I think I learned to have a more effective reflection about the way I'm going to solve a problem. Sometimes, we just want to throw ourselves in the code and we end up wanting to punch our screen because "well...what I do, now?".
Everything can't be done spontaneously, so sitting and preparing the steps to solve the problem is a precious preparation!

### Continued development

Coding logic in general is still a bit hard to ge through for me, sometimes...I have to train more on this!
