## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"[Field Name] cannot be empty"*
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Looks like this is not an email"*

## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- Sass
- JavaScript

### What I learned

I think I learned to have a more effective reflection about the way I'm going to solve a problem. Sometimes, we just want to throw ourselves in the code and we end up wanting to punch our screen because "well...what I do, now?".
Everything can't be done spontaneously, so sitting and preparing the steps to solve the problem is a precious preparation!

### Continued development

Coding logic in general is still a bit hard to ge through for me, sometimes...I have to train more on this!
